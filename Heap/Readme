The program implements a heap with following properties.
The root node stored in element zero in an array, its three children will be stored in elements 1 . . . 3, and so on.
The heap is a min-heap, stored in a resizable array (ArrayList).
Two functions (methods) are implemented for manipulating the heap.
An insert() function will add an arbitrary value to the heap, and a removeMin() function will remove the smallest value and
return it.
Using the heap and these two functions, a sequence of commands from standard input is read, one command per line. Each command will look like one of the following:
• add v
This inserts the given value, v to the heap, where v is a 32-bit, signed value.
• remove
This removes the minimum value from the heap and prints it on a line to standard output.
Commands will continue until the end-of-file on standard input. The program assumes incorrect input is not provided
