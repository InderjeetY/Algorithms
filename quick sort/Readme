In quicksort, normally we assume the base case to be one-element list. In practice, it may be faster to switch to a different sort when the list size gets small enough, without waiting until it reaches zero.
The program reads a sequence of 32-bit numbers form standard input. It will store them in an an array, sort them with quicksort, then print the sorted results to standard output, one value per line.
The program takes a command-line argument, k. This will tell it when to change sorting strategies.
When recursion reaches a list size of k or smaller, the quicksort will just sort the list using bubble sort, rather than continuing to quicksort it recursively.
